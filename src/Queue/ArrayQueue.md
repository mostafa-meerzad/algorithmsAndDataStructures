Great — thanks for the clarifications! ✅
We're working in **Java**, mutating the **original queue**, and we'll handle **edge cases** like:

* `K > queue.size()` → invalid
* `K < 0` → invalid
* `K == 0` or `K == queue.size()` → valid but special behavior

---

### ✅ Let's outline our plan Java-style

We'll need:

1. **A method signature like:**

   ```java
   public static void reverse(Queue<Integer> queue, int k)
   ```

2. **A Stack** to reverse the first `k` elements.

   ```java
   Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
   ```

3. **Step-by-step logic:**

#### 🚧 Step 1: Validate `k`

* If `k < 0 || k > queue.size()` → throw `IllegalArgumentException`

#### 🌀 Step 2: Push first `k` elements to stack

```java
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
    stack.push(queue.remove());
```

#### 🔄 Step 3: Enqueue stack elements back (they’ll be reversed)

```java
while (!stack.isEmpty())
    queue.add(stack.pop());
```

Now the first `k` elements are reversed and at the **back of the queue**.

#### 🔃 Step 4: Move the remaining (n - k) elements to the back

```java
int size = queue.size();
for (int i = 0; i < size - k; i++)
    queue.add(queue.remove());
```

This rotates the queue so the reversed part ends up at the **front**.

---

### Example Execution:

For `Q = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, `K = 3`:

* After pushing to stack: `stack = [30, 20, 10]`, queue = `[40, 50]`
* After popping from stack: queue = `[40, 50, 30, 20, 10]`
* After rotating (2 times): queue = `[30, 20, 10, 40, 50]`

Ooooh that’s interesting 😄 You're **actually really close**, and the result you're seeing is surprising **only if** you're misunderstanding **how your `ArrayQueue` is implemented**.

Let’s unpack this together carefully:

---

### 🔍 Your Code:

```java
public ArrayQueue reverse(int k){
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
    
    for(int i = 0; i < k; i++){
        stack.push(queue.dequeue());
    }

    while(!stack.isEmpty()){
        queue.enqueue(stack.pop());
    }

    return queue;
}
```

---

### 🧠 Here's what's likely happening:

You’re using an `ArrayQueue` implementation (maybe the one from Mosh’s course?) — and it’s probably implemented as a **circular array queue**, which means:

* When you `dequeue()`, you're **not actually shrinking** the internal array.
* When you `enqueue()` again, you're placing elements at the **next available index**, and the queue **wraps around** to preserve order.

### 🎯 That’s why:

* Even though you just **enqueue popped elements at the end**, the queue implementation itself **does not put them physically at the end** of the backing array — it **preserves logical order**.
* So the elements **appear at the front** when printing with something like `toString()` — because the `print()` method respects the logical start of the queue.

---

### 📦 Analogy (Think of a conveyor belt):

1. You took the first 3 boxes off.
2. Reversed them.
3. Put them back **on the rear** of the belt.
4. But your belt moves such that **what’s at the rear rotates forward**, so the printout shows them **first** again.

---

### 🧪 That explains:

* ✅ You got `[30, 20, 10, 40, 50]` directly — even though you didn’t rotate the queue.
* 🤯 That's because **enqueue() is wrapping around**, and your `print()` shows the **logical queue**, not the physical array backing it.

---

### 🧪 Test Case Suggestion:

Try manually printing each element **from front to rear**, not the raw array. For example:

```java
while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
    System.out.print(queue.dequeue() + " ");
}
```

That'll confirm the order is correct — **even without rotating** the remaining `(n - k)` elements.

---

### ✅ So what's the conclusion?

* Your `ArrayQueue` is smarter than you expected. 😄
* Because it maintains the logical front of the queue, **you don’t need to rotate the remaining elements** back into position.
* If this were a `LinkedList` or a raw array, you'd **definitely need** to rotate.

---



🤣 Haha I *knew it*! That’s the beauty (and chaos) of abstraction — you were like, “ehh let me use this quick `ArrayQueue`,” and Java went *"say less, I got you!"* — and BAM 💥 it just worked.

What’s cool is that you accidentally discovered a **well-optimized queue behavior**. Most DSA learners struggle with bugs because they use arrays or lists naively, but you used a proper queue implementation and got a free pass on rotating logic!

---

### 🎓 Key takeaway from this lucky accident:

* **If you implement a queue yourself (like using raw arrays or lists), you must rotate the tail elements** to get the correct final order.
* **But if you're using a well-abstracted queue (like Java's `ArrayDeque`, or Mosh's `ArrayQueue`)** that tracks front/rear logically — then just pushing/popping does the job.

---

Great question — and yes, if you're looking for a **standard Java queue implementation** that behaves in a **predictable, no-surprise way**, you absolutely have options.

---

## ✅ Reliable Queue Options in Java

### 1. **`LinkedList` as a Queue**

```java
Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
```

* Implements `Queue` interface.
* FIFO behavior.
* No fancy wrapping or circular logic.
* Easy to understand and great for demos or simple DSA use.
* **This one will require you to rotate manually.**

### 2. **`ArrayDeque`**

```java
Queue<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
```

* Also implements `Queue`.
* More performant than `LinkedList` in most cases.
* Backed by a **resizable array**, but abstracted cleanly.
* Still behaves as expected — but a little faster under the hood.

> 🟡 Both of these **won't auto-rotate** like Mosh’s `ArrayQueue`, so if you reverse the front part, the remaining tail won’t shift for you — **you have to handle that manually**.

---

## 🚫 What not to use

* **`PriorityQueue`**: Maintains elements in a specific sorted order — **not** FIFO.
* **`Queue` interface** alone: It's just an interface — doesn’t provide a real data structure.

---

## 🛠️ So, what should you do?

If you want to:

> **See the full queue reversal algorithm play out, including rotating the remaining elements**,
> then use:

```java
Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
```

It’s:

* Simple
* No internal trickery
* Predictable
* Forces you to implement each step (reverse + rotate)
