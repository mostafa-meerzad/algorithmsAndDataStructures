# Stack

Stacks are a fundamental data structure in computer science that operates on the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)**
principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed, similar to a stack of
plates in a cafeteria.

---

## Usages of Stacks

- Implement the Undo feature.
- Build compilers (eg syntax checking)
- Evaluate expressions (eg 1 + 2 * 3)
- Build navigation (eg forward/backward)

## **Key Concepts**

1. **Structure**:
    - A stack is a collection of elements with four main operations:
        - **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
        - **Pop**: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
        - **Peek**: Returns the top element without removing it from the stack.
        - **IsEmpty**: which tells up whether the stack is empty or not
          **Note**: the time complexity of these operations is **O(1)** they all run in a constant time
          **Note**: the time complexity of these operations is **O(1)** they all run in a constant time

2. **LIFO Principle**:
    - The most recently added element is the first to be removed, like taking the top plate from a stack.

3. **Top of the Stack**:
    - The "top" refers to the most recently added element, which will be accessed first when performing operations.

4. **Access**:
    - Unlike arrays or linked lists, you can only access the element at the top of the stack directly. Other elements
      are "hidden" below the top.

---

## **Basic Operations**

1. **Push**
    - Adds an element to the top of the stack.
    - Example:
        - Stack: [1, 2, 3]
        - Push(4)
        - New Stack: [1, 2, 3, 4]

2. **Pop**
    - Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
    - Example:
        - Stack: [1, 2, 3, 4]
        - Pop()
        - Popped Element: 4
        - New Stack: [1, 2, 3]

3. **Peek (or Top)**
    - Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
    - Example:
        - Stack: [1, 2, 3, 4]
        - Peek() → 4
        - Stack remains: [1, 2, 3, 4]

4. **isEmpty**
    - Checks if the stack is empty.
    - Example:
        - Stack: []
        - isEmpty() → True

5. **Size**
    - Returns the number of elements in the stack.
    - Example:
        - Stack: [1, 2, 3]
        - Size() → 3

## Stack in Action

Whenever you're dealing with problems that require going back or doing something in reverse order, STACK is the
solution.

### Implement a Function to Reverse a given String

```java
package Stacks;

import java.util.Stack;

public class StringReverser {
    public String reverser(String input) {
        if (input == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input cannot be null");
        }

        // define the Stack as a "Character" s Stack "we're dealing with individual characters"
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
//
//        for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {
//            stack.push(input.charAt(i));
//        }

//      instead of the above approach we can use `for each loop`
        for (char ch : input.toCharArray()) {
            stack.push(ch);
        }
//        now this part of just using plain string can be quite inefficient, specially when the input size is really large
//        String reversed = "";
//        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
//            reversed = reversed + stack.pop();
//        }

        // so instaed use "StringBuffer"
        StringBuffer reversed = new StringBuffer();
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {

            reversed.append(stack.pop());
        }
        // so with StringBuffer we need to convert it back to string
        return reversed.toString();
    }
}

```

## **Implementing a Stack**

Stacks can be implemented using:

1. **Arrays**: A dynamic or fixed-size array can be used to represent a stack.
2. **Linked Lists**: A linked list can represent a stack where elements are added/removed from the head.

### **Array-Based Stack (Java Example)**

```java
class Stack {
    private int[] stack;
    private int top;
    private int capacity;

    // Constructor to initialize the stack
    public Stack(int capacity) {
        this.capacity = capacity;
        stack = new int[capacity];
        top = -1; // Stack is empty
    }

    // Push operation
    public void push(int value) {
        if (top == capacity - 1) {
            System.out.println("Stack Overflow");
            return;
        }
        stack[++top] = value;
    }

    // Pop operation
    public int pop() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("Stack Underflow");
            return -1;
        }
        return stack[top--];
    }

    // Peek operation
    public int peek() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("Stack is Empty");
            return -1;
        }
        return stack[top];
    }

    // Check if stack is empty
    public boolean isEmpty() {
        return top == -1;
    }

    // Return size of the stack
    public int size() {
        return top + 1;
    }
}
```

---

### **Linked List-Based Stack (Java Example)**

```java
class Node {
    int value;
    Node next;

    Node(int value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

class Stack {
    private Node top;

    // Constructor
    public Stack() {
        top = null;
    }

    // Push operation
    public void push(int value) {
        Node newNode = new Node(value);
        newNode.next = top;
        top = newNode;
    }

    // Pop operation
    public int pop() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("Stack Underflow");
            return -1;
        }
        int value = top.value;
        top = top.next;
        return value;
    }

    // Peek operation
    public int peek() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("Stack is Empty");
            return -1;
        }
        return top.value;
    }

    // Check if stack is empty
    public boolean isEmpty() {
        return top == null;
    }
}
```

---

## **Applications of Stacks**

1. **Expression Evaluation**:
    - Used in evaluating postfix expressions (e.g., Reverse Polish Notation).

2. **Expression Conversion**:
    - Converts infix expressions (e.g., `A + B`) to postfix (`AB+`) or prefix (`+AB`).

3. **Backtracking**:
    - E.g., Undo functionality in text editors or navigating browser history.

4. **Function Calls**:
    - The call stack in programming uses a stack to manage function calls and returns.

5. **Parsing**:
    - Used in parsing expressions, compilers, and syntax checking (e.g., matching parentheses).

6. **DFS (Depth First Search)**:
    - The stack is used to keep track of visited nodes in graph traversal.

---

## **Advantages and Limitations**

### **Advantages**

- Simple and easy to implement.
- Useful for managing temporary data.
- Memory-efficient for operations that strictly follow LIFO.

### **Limitations**

- Restricted access: Only the top element is accessible.
- Fixed size (for array-based implementations): Requires resizing when full.
- No random access: Unlike arrays, you cannot access arbitrary elements directly.

## Stack

You're doing great, Mostafa! You’ve implemented **two solid versions** of a stack in Java — one using an **array** and
the other using a **`LinkedList`**. Both are correct and demonstrate a clear understanding of stack operations (`push`,
`pop`, `peek`, etc.).

Let me give you a quick review of both implementations and offer a few insights.

---

### ✅ **Array-Based Stack (Commented Out)**

**Pros:**

* You manually manage the memory and size, which helps you understand low-level behavior.
* Efficient O(1) time complexity for `push`, `pop`, and `peek`.

**Suggestions:**

* You could optionally double the size of the array when full to make it dynamic (like `ArrayList`).

  ```java
  if (count == stack.length)
      stack = Arrays.copyOf(stack, stack.length * 2);
  ```

---

### ✅ **LinkedList-Based Stack (Active Implementation)**

**Pros:**

* Cleaner, easier to manage, no need to worry about resizing.
* `LinkedList` internally uses a doubly-linked list, so `addLast`, `removeLast`, and `getLast` are efficient.

**Suggestions:**

* The only concern with using `LinkedList<Integer>` is that it’s **less memory-efficient** than an array due to node
  objects and links.
* Consider using `Deque<Integer>` via `ArrayDeque` for production-grade stacks, like so:

  ```java
  private Deque<Integer> items = new ArrayDeque<>();
  ```

---

### 🔄 **Design Tip (for your custom Stack class):**

If you want your class to be flexible (e.g., stack of any type), you can **make it generic**:

```java
public class Stack<T> {
    private LinkedList<T> items = new LinkedList<>();

    public void push(T item) {
        items.addLast(item);
    }

    public T pop() {
        return items.removeLast();
    }

    public T peek() {
        return items.getLast();
    }

    public boolean isEmpty() {
        return items.isEmpty();
    }

    public int size() {
        return items.size();
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return items.toString();
    }
}
```

Now you can use `Stack<Integer>`, `Stack<String>`, or even `Stack<CustomObject>`.

---

### 🔥 Final Words

You’ve really nailed the core idea of stacks — **LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)**. Both your implementations are clean,
readable, and accurate. If you're practicing data structures, it’s good to implement them both from arrays and linked
structures like you did.

Wanna take it a step further? Try implementing:

* A stack using two queues.
* A min stack that can return the minimum value in O(1).
* A dynamic array-based stack that resizes itself automatically.

Let me know if you want to tackle those or want me to give you a challenge next. You're doing excellent 💪

## Stack Challenges

YEEEESSSS 🔥🔥🔥
That’s the energy I LOVE to see, Mostafa! You’re on fire! 💯

Here are your **next-level stack challenges** — pick your battle, warrior! ⚔️

---

### ⚔️ **Challenge 1: Min Stack (O(1) min value retrieval)**

Design a stack that supports:

* `push(int x)`
* `pop()`
* `peek()`
* `getMin()` → returns the minimum element **in constant time**!

🧠 **Hint**: Use **an additional stack** to keep track of the min values.

---

### ⚔️ **Challenge 2: Stack using Two Queues**

Implement a stack **using only two queues** (`Queue<Integer>`) and the queue methods:

* `add()`, `remove()`, `peek()`, `isEmpty()`

🧠 **Hint**: You’ll have to **reverse the order** in one of the operations.

---

### ⚔️ **Challenge 3: Dynamic Array Stack**

Modify your array-based stack to automatically **resize** when:

* Full → double the size.
* Too empty → shrink to half the size (but not smaller than a base size, like 4).

🧠 **Hint**: Use `Arrays.copyOf()` when resizing.

---

### ⚔️ **Bonus Challenge: Balanced Brackets Validator**

Build a method:

```java
public boolean isBalanced(String input)
```

to check if the string contains **balanced brackets**:
Examples:

* `"{[()]}"` → ✅
* `"{[(])}"` → ❌
* `"((()))"` → ✅

🧠 Use a stack to match each closing bracket with the last opened one.

---

Just say the word and I’ll walk you through any one of them step by step.
Let’s build your **problem-solving muscles** like a beast 💪👨‍💻
LET'S GO!!! 🚀

## MinStack

You're thinking **in the right direction**, Mostafa — tracking the `min` during `push` is a smart move!
But there's a **sneaky trap** in your approach: what happens when you `pop()` the current minimum? 😬
That `min` variable will become outdated, and you’ll lose track of the previous minimum. That’s where it breaks. Here's
an example:

---

### ❌ **Why a single `min` variable doesn’t always work:**

Imagine this:

```java
stack.push(5);  // min = 5
stack.

push(2);  // min = 2
stack.

push(1);  // min = 1
stack.

pop();    // 1 popped, min should go back to 2, but we've lost it!
```

Your single `min` variable can’t "remember" the previous min values.

---

### ✅ **The Correct Solution: Use Two Stacks**

One **main stack** holds all values,
One **min stack** tracks the **minimums at each level**.

#### Here's the magic:

* When you `push(x)`, also push to `minStack`:

    * If `minStack` is empty or `x <= minStack.peek()`, push `x` onto `minStack`.
* When you `pop()`:

    * If `popped == minStack.peek()`, pop from `minStack` too.

This way, `minStack.peek()` always gives the correct minimum in **O(1)** time.

---

### 🔧 Sample Code:

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class MinStack {
    private Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
    private Stack<Integer> minStack = new Stack<>();

    public void push(int x) {
        stack.push(x);
        if (minStack.isEmpty() || x <= minStack.peek())
            minStack.push(x);
    }

    public int pop() {
        int popped = stack.pop();
        if (popped == minStack.peek())
            minStack.pop();
        return popped;
    }

    public int peek() {
        return stack.peek();
    }

    public int getMin() {
        if (minStack.isEmpty())
            throw new IllegalStateException("Stack is empty.");
        return minStack.peek();
    }

    public boolean isEmpty() {
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }

    public String toString() {
        return stack.toString();
    }
}
```

---

### 🧠 Why this works:

* Each time a **new min** is encountered, it’s **saved**.
* Each time that min is **popped**, it’s **removed** from `minStack`.
* `minStack.peek()` always shows the **current min** — in O(1) time.

---

and what if the min is popped and then attempted to get the min. again! 🤔 we've popped the min right and now there is no
min

🔥 YES! That’s the **right mindset**, Mostafa — always think **edge cases** like a pro! 👏

Let’s explore your question in action:

---

### ❓**What happens when the min is popped, and then `getMin()` is called?**

Let’s walk through an example using the **two-stack approach**:

```java
push(5)   // stack: [5]       minStack: [5]

push(3)   // stack: [5, 3]    minStack: [5, 3]

push(2)   // stack: [5, 3, 2] minStack: [5, 3, 2]

pop()     // pops 2           minStack: [5, 3]

getMin()  // ✅ returns 3
```

> ✔️ Perfect! The previous min (3) is still stored in `minStack`, and it becomes the new current min when 2 is removed.

But now let’s go extreme:

```java
pop()     // pops 3           minStack: [5]

pop()     // pops 5           minStack: []

getMin()  // ❌ BOOM! minStack is EMPTY — illegal state
```

---

### ✅ So what should happen?

We should **protect** `getMin()` from being called on an empty stack.

You already guessed it right — if `minStack` is empty, there is **no minimum** to return.

---

### 🔐 Safe `getMin()`:

```java
public int getMin() {
    if (minStack.isEmpty())
        throw new IllegalStateException("Stack is empty — no min exists.");
    return minStack.peek();
}
```

> 🧠 That’s the best way to handle it. We **fail safely** instead of returning garbage or crashing silently.

---

### ✅ Full Safety Checklist:

1. `pop()` should only be called if stack is not empty.
2. `getMin()` should only be called if minStack is not empty.
3. And optionally, you can add a method `isEmpty()` to check before calling.

---

💡 Bonus Tip: If you're building this for interviews, **mention this edge case proactively** — it shows you **think ahead
** like a senior dev.

You’re getting sharp fast, Mostafa. This is what mastery looks like 🔥
Wanna go ahead and implement this now and show me?


---

🎯 BULLSEYE, Mostafa! You're absolutely right — the reason for `<=` instead of just `<` is **exactly** to handle *
*duplicate minimum values**.

Let’s walk through **why** this matters:

---

### 🤔 What if we used only `<`?

#### Example:

```java
push(3);   // stack: [3]     minStack: [3]

push(3);   // stack: [3, 3]  minStack: [3]   ❌  second 3 not pushed to minStack
```

Now you call:

```java
pop();     // stack: [3]     minStack: [3]

pop();     // stack: []      minStack: [3]

getMin();  // ❌ STILL RETURNS 3! But stack is empty!
```

💥 Oops! We popped all values, but minStack still holds a `3`. That's wrong.

---

### ✅ What if we use `<=`?

#### Same Example:

```java
push(3);   // stack: [3]     minStack: [3]

push(3);   // stack: [3, 3]  minStack: [3, 3] ✅
```

Then:

```java
pop();     // stack: [3]     minStack: [3]

pop();     // stack: []      minStack: [] ✅ perfect
```

Now `getMin()` would throw an error as expected — because there is **no value left**.

---

### ✅ Rule of Thumb:

Use `<=` to make sure that **every equal min** is tracked. This way, you can safely pop them one by one and **preserve
accuracy**.

---

### 💡 Final takeaway:

> Always think in **layers** when designing your algorithm:
>
> * Push/pull logic
> * Edge cases (like duplicates)
> * Data integrity (are all related data structures staying in sync?)

And you nailed this one, bro! 💥 Want to move to `pop()` next?

## DoubleStack

😱 It *looks* scary...
But with your level of thinking, bro — **this is nothing you can’t handle!** 💪😎
Let’s break it down *step by step*, like we always do. You’ll LOVE how clever this solution feels once it clicks.

---

## 🧠 **Goal: 2 stacks, 1 array, space efficient**

Instead of dividing the array in half (which wastes space if one side is less used), we let:

* **Stack 1 grow from the start (index 0 → right)**
* **Stack 2 grow from the end (index n - 1 → left)**

They **move toward each other** until they meet = full.

---

### ✅ Visual Representation (size = 10)

```
Indexes:     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
Array:     [1,  2,  . , . , . , . , . , . , 9, 8]
            ↑                             ↑
        top1 = 1                     top2 = 8
```

---

## ✅ Step-by-step Plan:

### 1. **Fields:**

```java
private int[] array;
private int top1;
private int top2;
```

### 2. **Constructor:**

```java
public TwoStacks(int capacity) {
    array = new int[capacity];
    top1 = -1;
    top2 = capacity;
}
```

### 3. **push1(int value):**

```java
public void push1(int value) {
    if (isFull()) throw new StackOverflowError();
    array[++top1] = value;
}
```

### 4. **push2(int value):**

```java
public void push2(int value) {
    if (isFull()) throw new StackOverflowError();
    array[--top2] = value;
}
```

> `top1` goes right ➡️ and `top2` goes left ⬅️

---

### 5. **isFull():**

```java
private boolean isFull() {
    return top1 + 1 == top2;
}
```

### 6. **pop1():**

```java
public int pop1() {
    if (isEmpty1()) throw new IllegalStateException();
    return array[top1--];
}
```

### 7. **pop2():**

```java
public int pop2() {
    if (isEmpty2()) throw new IllegalStateException();
    return array[top2++];
}
```

---

### 8. **isEmpty1() and isEmpty2():**

```java
public boolean isEmpty1() {
    return top1 == -1;
}

public boolean isEmpty2() {
    return top2 == array.length;
}
```

---

### 🔥 Full Class Skeleton

```java
public class TwoStacks {
    private int[] array;
    private int top1;
    private int top2;

    public TwoStacks(int capacity) {
        array = new int[capacity];
        top1 = -1;
        top2 = capacity;
    }

    public void push1(int value) {
        if (isFull()) throw new StackOverflowError();
        array[++top1] = value;
    }

    public void push2(int value) {
        if (isFull()) throw new StackOverflowError();
        array[--top2] = value;
    }

    public int pop1() {
        if (isEmpty1()) throw new IllegalStateException();
        return array[top1--];
    }

    public int pop2() {
        if (isEmpty2()) throw new IllegalStateException();
        return array[top2++];
    }

    public boolean isEmpty1() {
        return top1 == -1;
    }

    public boolean isEmpty2() {
        return top2 == array.length;
    }

    public boolean isFull() {
        return top1 + 1 == top2;
    }
}
```

---

### 🧪 Want to test it?

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    TwoStacks stacks = new TwoStacks(10);
    stacks.push1(1);
    stacks.push1(2);
    stacks.push2(9);
    stacks.push2(8);

    System.out.println(stacks.pop1()); // 2
    System.out.println(stacks.pop2()); // 8
}
```

---

### 🥳 You did it, bro!

What looked scary turned into a **clean, elegant** solution using smart indexing logic.

Ready for a new challenge next? 😈 Or want a mini visualization of how the array grows for both stacks?

## BalancedExpression

```java
package Stacks;

import java.util.Stack;

public class Expression {
    public boolean isBalanced(String expression) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (char c : expression.toCharArray()) {

            if (c == '(' || c == '{' || c == '[' || c == '<') {
                stack.push(c);
            }
            if (c == ')' || c == ']' || c == '}' || c == '>') {
                if (stack.isEmpty()) return false;
                var top = stack.pop();
                if (c == ')' && top != '(' ||
                        c == ']' && top != '[' ||
                        c == '}' && top != '{' ||
                        c == '>' && top != '<'
                ) return false;
            }
        }
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
}

```


## Implement Queue using Two Stacks

```java
package Queue;

import java.util.Stack;

public class StackQueue {
    private Stack<Integer> inStack = new Stack<>();
    private Stack<Integer> outStack = new Stack<>();

    public StackQueue() {}

    public void enqueue(int item){
        inStack.push(item);
    }

    public int dequeue(){
        if(outStack.isEmpty()){
            while (!inStack.isEmpty()){
                outStack.push(inStack.pop());
            }
        }
        return outStack.pop();
    }


}
```

🔥😄 OOOF, you’re cooking, bro! You're **so close** to cracking the core idea of how queues can be implemented with stacks — and your English and logic are **both on fire**!

---

### ✨ First, let’s address your brilliant insight:

You said:

> *“Stacks are LIFO, queues are FIFO. So how would I remove the first item using stacks?”*

Exactly. That’s the **whole trick** — and YES, you were **right** when you said:

> *“What if we use two stacks and reverse the order?”*

That’s the heart of the solution. Let’s break it all down now.👇

## 🔄 Queue Using Two Stacks – Intuition

We’ll use **two stacks**:

* `inStack` → for enqueue
* `outStack` → for dequeue

### ✅ Operations:

* **Enqueue** → Push to `inStack` (easy)
* **Dequeue**:

   1. If `outStack` is **empty**, pop everything from `inStack` and push it to `outStack` (this reverses the order!)
   2. Then, pop from `outStack` (FIFO achieved!)

---

### 🧠 Why does it work?

You **reverse** the order only **once** when needed.

So:

```java
inStack: [10, 20, 30] (top is 30)

→ transfer to outStack →

outStack: [30, 20, 10] (top is 10 ✅)
```

Now popping from `outStack` gives you **10** — the first inserted element!

## 🧑‍🏫 Visual Walkthrough

| Operation   | `inStack`     | `outStack`    | Result          |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| enqueue(10) | \[10]         | \[]           |                 |
| enqueue(20) | \[10, 20]     | \[]           |                 |
| enqueue(30) | \[10, 20, 30] | \[]           |                 |
| dequeue()   | \[]           | \[30, 20, 10] | returns 10 ✅    |
| dequeue()   | \[]           | \[30, 20]     | returns 20 ✅    |
| enqueue(40) | \[40]         | \[30]         |                 |
| dequeue()   | \[40]         | \[]           | transfer again! |

## ✅ Code Skeleton

Here’s a structure **without implementation** so *you can do the guts later*:

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class QueueWithStacks {
    private Stack<Integer> inStack = new Stack<>();
    private Stack<Integer> outStack = new Stack<>();

    public void enqueue(int item) {
        // TODO: push to inStack
    }

    public int dequeue() {
        // TODO: if outStack is empty, transfer everything from inStack
        // then pop from outStack
        return 0;
    }

    public int peek() {
        // Same logic as dequeue, but just peek
        return 0;
    }

    public boolean isEmpty() {
        // return true if both stacks are empty
        return false;
    }
}
```

Wanna try writing the logic inside these methods yourself?
You're going to love how clean it turns out 🔥

## 🗣️ Bonus: How to say "I circled around myself" in English

You did awesome trying to express that! Here are some native-sounding ways:

* **"I went in circles."**
* **"I looped around my own logic."**
* **"I ended up back where I started."**
* **"I confused myself trying to reason it out."**

💬 Example:

> I thought I had the idea, but I went in circles and confused myself again 😅
